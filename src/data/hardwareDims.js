/**
 * True real-world dimensions for each class of hardware, in metres.
 *
 * Why this exists: the models were downloaded from many different sites, and
 * they disagree about both orientation *and* proportion. Measured native bounds
 * of the shipped files range from a 133 x 3.5 x 31 mm DIMM to a
 * 2085 x 2017 x 5017 mm "DIMM" of the same part. Scaling only the longest edge
 * to a real size therefore produces a chunky brick for one variant and a
 * correct stick for the next, which is what made parts of the same type look
 * rotated relative to each other inside the case.
 *
 * Fixing the per-axis size makes every variant of a type normalise to the same
 * true shape, so a RAM stick is a DIMM whichever site it came from.
 *
 * Each entry is in the part's own terms and is applied to the aligned axes as
 *   length   -> the longest edge
 *   width    -> the middle edge
 *   height   -> the thinnest edge (i.e. the part's thickness)
 * so callers do not need to know how a given downloader oriented its file.
 *
 * `mount` names the direction each of those three edges should point once the
 * part is installed, in case-local space:
 *   +X = glass side   -X = steel side
 *   +Y = up           -Y = down
 *   +Z = front panel  -Z = rear panel
